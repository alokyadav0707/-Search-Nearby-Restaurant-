# -Search-Nearby-Restaurant-
This project implements a C++-based solution to locate nearby restaurants within a rectangular query region using Range Trees in 2D space.

Designed an efficient tree-based algorithm to identify data points within user-specified query boundaries.

Constructed Range Trees with binary search on sorted x and y coordinates for balanced preprocessing and query performance.

Achieved O(n log n) time complexity for tree construction and O(m + (log n)^2) for querying, making it scalable for large datasets.

Tailored for real-world applications, enabling fast and accurate searches for restaurants or similar data points in extensive geographic datasets.

This project demonstrates expertise in spatial data structures, efficient querying, and algorithmic design for large-scale applications.
